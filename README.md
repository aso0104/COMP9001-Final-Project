# COMP9001-Final-Project

My program simulates an interactive garden where users can plant, water, fertilize, and harvest flowers on a 3x3 grid. There are three types of flowers to choose, rose/sunflower/cherry blossom. Each flower grows gradually through watering and fertilizing, and once fully grown, it can be harvested into a basket. The program displays a visual map of the garden by representing flowers with vivid emojis. It also provides commands like and flower inspection for users to track the growth status of each flower, which would help them to manage their own garden easily. This program may be suitable for gardening enthusiasts who want to have their own little virtual garden.
